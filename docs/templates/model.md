# Model

The goal of the framework is to provide a set of common models that you might want to use. We don't want to restrict or 
prioritize the use of neural networks over other, more classical machine learning methods. We know that a lot of the machine 
learning-based services and products in the industry are built over conventional machine learning techniques. In any case, 
we are covering a huge range of models, including support for some popular deep learning frameworks. Of course, if you want 
to use your own model, the framework is easily extensible.

The abstract class [TrainableModel](./#trainablemodel-class) defines the methods 
that every model has to implement in order to interact with the framework. 
For example, the class [DeepLearningModel](./supervised/#deeplearningmodel) is used to wrap a compiled 
keras or tensorflow model. 
If you want to use your own custom model, you just have to implement the wrapper methods 
of the [TrainableModel](./#trainablemodel-class) class.
